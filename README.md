# React Sorting Visualizer

This is a sorting visualizer developed in React for some of the most common sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, and quick), intended to serve as a reference for new programmers (and experienced progammers who don't quite remember how exactly quick sort works). All algorithms and animations were implemented from scratch and are included in this repository.
